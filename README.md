# PrimeNumbers
Repository containing code that aims to find prime numbers and displays a list of them available on the web.

The idea of ​​the repository is to create the most optimized code possible, to generate increasingly larger prime numbers and add them to the primes.txt list

## You can also check if a number is prime using

```bash 
gcc ./checkPrimes.c -o checkPrimes

./checkPrimes
```

```
user@user$ time ./checkPrimes
Enter a number: 1779999803
1779999803 is a prime number.
